While working as an accountant for Fleer Chewing Gum Company, the 23-year-old experimented with new gum recipes during his spare time. One day he accidentally made a formula that was less sticky and more flexible which made it easier to blow bubbles.<br\/><br\/>The company loved Dimer’s product and quickly began to market it as “Double Bubble.” It remained the only bubble gum on the market until Bazooka bubble gum was created after WWII.<br\/><br\/>Chewing gum, however, was already popular for quite some time before bubble gum was invented. For example, William Wrigley Jr. launched two gum brands, Juicy Fruit and Wrigley’s Spearmint, in 1928 after using them as promotions when he worked as a soap salesman.
